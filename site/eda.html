          <h2>3.1 Clustering of Impedance Patterns</h2>
          <p>
            Natural groupings of electrochemical behaviour were identified by clustering both CNN latent embeddings and
            UMAP features. The following algorithms were benchmarked:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>K-Means:</strong> Partitioning clusters based on Euclidean impedance similarity.</li>
            <li><strong>DBSCAN:</strong> Density-based clustering suitable for non-spherical manifolds.</li>
            <li><strong>Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM):</strong> Probabilistic modelling of overlapping impedance states.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Cluster validity was quantified using Silhouette, Davies–Bouldin, and Calinski–Harabasz indices. Distinct
            clusters corresponded to characteristic impedance signatures, including mid-frequency semicircle
            enlargement and low-frequency tail elongation, indicative of SEI growth and diffusion resistance increases.

          <h2>3.2 Optimal Frequency Regions for SOC Prediction</h2>
          <p>
            Analysis of cluster centroids revealed that mid-frequency regions between <strong>1–100 Hz</strong> delivered the
            greatest discriminative power for State-of-Charge (SOC) and State-of-Health (SOH) differentiation. These
            frequencies predominantly reflect charge-transfer resistance and interfacial kinetics, marking them as prime
            candidates for reduced-order modelling and real-time impedance-based diagnostics.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2>3.3 Anomaly Detection</h2>
          <p>
            Spectral integrity was safeguarded using a dual-stage anomaly detection scheme:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Isolation Forest:</strong> Detected spectra deviating from the learned impedance manifold.</li>
            <li><strong>Autoencoder Reconstruction Error:</strong> Flagged physically inconsistent curves by thresholding reconstruction loss.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Combining these strategies ensured that only electrochemically valid spectra contributed to downstream
            learning tasks and that aberrant measurements were escalated for manual review.
          </p>
