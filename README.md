# AnomolousEISData.github.io
This repository focuses on identifying anomalous battery cells withi groups of varying chemistries and mass loading. Using impedance spectroscoy data collected at multpile state of charge, we perfrom exploratory analysis to find the most predictive SOC, followed by modelling to detect anomalies based on rate capability
